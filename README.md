# generator-grid-fce

## Getting Started

### What is generator-grid-fce?

It's a [Yeoman][1] generator to create flexible content elements with gridelements in [Typo3][2] version 6.2 or higher

### Requirements ###
#### [Yeoman][3] ####
Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-grid-fce
```

#### [gridelements_fce][4] ####
In frontend typoscript configuration, the generator use gridelements_fce for building loop on flexform section

#### plugin configuration ####
It's a best practice to store your flex in a plugin or at least in your skin plugin. We just have some requirement for this plugin but if those files don't exist yet, the generator will create them for you.
**What do we need ?**
 - in **ext_emconf.php**, a `'createDirs' => ''` should be set. It'll be filled when one of your FCE need a upload directory
 - in **ext_localconf.php**, a `// ## insert here` comment for TSConfig insertion
 - in **ext_typoscript_setup.txt**, a `## // insert here` comment for Typoscript insertion


## Launch generator ##
Initiate the generator in the typo3 extension where you want to store  flexible content elements:

```
$ yo grid-fce
```

Follow instructions and build your own content element

**Choose the type of custom element**
```
[?] Content element type: (Use arrow keys)
â€£ Based on Click to Play Youtube video  // -> Copy a "Click To play" element
  Based on Image Caption                // -> Copy a "Image Caption" element
  Based on Slideshow                    // -> Copy a "Slideshow" element
  Full content element                  // -> Copy a full element
  --------
  Exit                                  // -> I let you guess
```
